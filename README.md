# Currency Converter for Native Android ðŸ’°

Hi ðŸ‘‹! This application converts currency for native Android. I wanted to create a currency conversion application that fits within the Material Design aesthetic to fit my Pixel. 

The application was, overall, simple to design and develop as I utilized Figma's Material Design kit to mock the components, which were easy to translate into Jetpack Compose using the provided Composables.
